This is just a simple project for me to learn the ins and outs of
Tkinter in Python 2.7. I'm currently working with grid placement and 
trying to learn how to make a GUI look clean using this method. I 
would also like to make the program output data formatted in html.

    -Fix formatting issues in Statistics section
    -Fix formatting issues in Resistances section
    -Remove unnecessary grid formatting

    -Create Armor Class section
    -Finish this README
